        two rooms, adjacent to the hall with the same on top, it in fact has four. Hence double is bigger, bigger is better
        and better is here. It featuring a Colombages Hall and traditional floor tiles with original beams and stonework. 
        The house is three hundred square foot in total. A large wooden staircase and landing in the centre of the house 
        makes it very open and accessible whilst maintaining all of the creaks and groans from when it was originally built. 
        Large 18thcentury windows that no longer close properly are present as are a myriad of flora and fauna that adorn 
        the outside walls. Many things about this house are old and original whilst some parts have been “updated” to prevent 
        it from collapsing or just to make it habitable. One could only recommend that you come and stay for a couple of days 
        to make a first hand assessment instead of relying on photographs.",

        for; the ancient Roman capital of the department, Auch, is 45 mins away. Other historical towns such as Lupiac, Mirande,
        Tarbes and Pau are also nearby. The barbecue terrace can seat up to 20 plus people and is perfect for relaxing in the

        it was in the past, de Beauvoir pairs extremely well with Jean Paul Satre as they share a courtyard not only allowing a 
        larger family to holiday together but also provide privacy for a couple or the black sheep of the family that finds spending

        Ni then we must sadly inform you that these are not for sale nor would they be nice enough.
        Despite having so many plants the grounds are very open and a vineyard borders the property.
        There is a 12 x 6 swimming pool overlooking the surrounding countryside making this property a perfect venue for weddings and 
        events whilst also providing, weather permitting, a fun and debauched time to be had by all.
        Should the festivities prove too much then buckets can be provided as well as the option retreat into one of the gites to contemplate
        where it all went wrong.",
